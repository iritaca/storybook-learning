# React + TypeScript + Vite + Storybook + Yarn

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with some ESLint rules,
Storybook for UI development, and basic testing support.

#### Why this template?
Setting up Storybook from scratch can be time-consuming - this template helps you skip the version mismatches, so you can focus on solving real problems.

As developers, we should spend more time building things that matter - not wrestling with setup or compatibility issues. :smile:
